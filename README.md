# MyReads Project
The Project to fetch books and categorize according to status, each status corresponds to a bookcase (Currently Reading, Want To Read, Read). In the search when the result is displayed the same can be verified if it already already belongs some shelf, by verifying the move to button.
The user can change the shelf livors as they change their status.

## TL;DR

To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
